1. Type 'docker-compose build' while in the root directory of the project to build the images from the two Dockerfiles and link them together.
2. Type 'docker-compose up' to start the two containers (the MySQL database and the flask API server).
3. Go to 'localhost:5000' to see the fruits of our labor. :)
